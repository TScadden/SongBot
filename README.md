Privacy Policy for SongBot
This privacy policy explains how SongBot ("the App") collects, uses, and protects user information. The App is a simple tool designed to automate song requests via Facebook Messenger and email.

1. Data We Collect
The App collects the following information when a user sends a song request:

Facebook ID: When you send a message to the App, Facebook provides us with your unique Facebook ID. We use this ID solely to send a response message back to you. This ID is not stored, shared, or used for any other purpose.

Song Request Details: The App processes the song title and artist information you provide in your message to search for a corresponding file.

Email Address: When you send an email request, we collect your email address to send a response back to you. This email address is not stored, shared, or used for any other purpose.

2. How We Use the Data
The information collected is used for the following purposes:

Fulfilling Requests: To search for the requested song and send a response back to the user.

Internal Logging: We log the requests in a private Google Sheet to track requests for songs that are not yet available. This information is for internal use only and is not shared with any third parties.

3. Data Storage
We do not permanently store your Facebook ID or email address. The song requests that are added to our Google Sheet are stored in a secure, private document and are not accessible by anyone other than the administrator of the App.

4. Third-Party Services
The App uses Google Apps Script to run its functionality and Google Drive and Sheets to manage files and log requests. Your data is handled in accordance with the privacy policies of these services.

5. Your Consent
By using the App, you consent to this privacy policy.
